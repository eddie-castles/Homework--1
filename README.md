## Homework--1 ~Introduction

This week I was asked to refactor an exisiting html and css code for website "Horiseon." I was given a mock up or end goal of what the website should look like and to get as close as possible to it. While also carrying the balance of writing an efficient, clean, accesible, consolidated stylesheeet and code. 

### Here is what I did 

I started by studying the html and css code and see how it was structured and what quick and easy things I could do to replicate the mock up I was given. Then once I got about 75% of the way there I started to focus on the details and constantly comparing the html and css files. By slowing down a little I began to notice even more ways to tidy up this website for Horiseon. I did stuff like making the text a little bigger to be easier to read. I repositioned some text and placed it exactly where it should be. Then I started to consolidate the css elements by grouping elements together and sometimes two elements at a time for an even cleaner back end. After it was cleaned up the stylesheet lost a lot of weight to it and it was actually a really clean code. This is when I started to put things in chronological order according to the html file.

## What I got out of this

Creating a accesible website is important for others that might need it is very important in web development. Always put yourself in the users shoes and anylize your website as if you are brand new to it. Something else that stuck with me was the lenghts you can go with css and how endless its possibilities really are. You can always go for an even cleaner code it just depends on the effort you want to put into it.
